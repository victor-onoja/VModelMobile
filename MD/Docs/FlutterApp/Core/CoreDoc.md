# Core Documentaion

#### The Core folder is a crucial component of the mobile project, containing the main logic and utilities that drive the app's functionality. This includes several key modules, such as:

##### - [Network](./CoreDoc/Network.md): This module is responsible for managing the definition of network requests and facilitating communication with external APIs. It ensures that data is transmitted and received efficiently and reliably .

##### - [cache](./CoreDoc/Cache.md): The Cache module handles local storage and caching of data. It helps to improve the app's developing performance by reducing the need for frequent code repeating and allowing for faster access to frequently used data.

##### - [Routing](./CoreDoc/Routing.md): The Routing module takes care of navigation and routing within the app. It provides a seamless and easier developing experience by directing users to the appropriate screens and content based on their actions and inputs.

##### - [Utilities](./CoreDoc/Utilities.md): The Utilities module contains a variety of utility functions and classes that support the app's functionality. These may include helper functions for data processing, formatting, and validation.

#### The Core folder is essential to the smooth operation of the app and should be maintained and updated regularly to ensure optimal performance. Developers working on this project should be familiar with the contents of this folder and its various modules
